        <h1> This is a heading </h1>
        <h6> this is also a heading </h6>
        <p> This is the paragraph of the webpage. </p>
        <p> This is abother paragraph of the webpage </p>
        <p> Here I will also show how to show the letters look bold and itallic </p>
        <p> Actually it is quite simple just write b and i tag where you want to make the specific text look <b> bold </b>and <i> itallic </i></p>
        <p> Now we can also write any letter allite below and a little above the main text.</p>
        <p> Formula is E=mc<sup>2</sup> And molecules are H<sub>2</sub>O CO<sub>2</sub> <br/> Also <strong> strong </strong>tag represent particular desired word or sentense in bold <br/> Whereas em tag represent the desired section in Italic all these are by  default. em means <em>Emphasis</em>.</p>
        <p> The use of q tag helps to set the quotation <q> that means the browser auto sets the double quotation </q> .</p>
        <p> The abbr  tag is useful to set the abbrebiations over any word  a title  attribute  is used to specify the full form or the full meaning....</p>
        <p> <abbr title="Engineer"> Er</abbr> Amrit poudel is currently working at ....tech </p>
        <p>The re are also tags for citation and definition but I do not know their use more precisly </p>
        <p><cite> Amrit poudel</cite> is done citing now is the turn for the <def> definition </def></p>
        <p> Also there is a address tag , it only makes itallic of the content written previous also there were many nonsense stupid tag which only make things itallic and bold iun the name of ciation and definition. </p>
        <i> <p> <a href="amritpaudelap85@gmail.com"> address </a> is my Email address </p>  </address> </i>
        <p> Suppose we delleta any word and re[;ace that word with another word than we use del tag and ins tag </p>
        <p> Suppose i need to <del> delete</del> <ins> DELETE </ins> SEE THE EFFECT  </p>
        <p> The S element indicates
            something that <s> is no longer
            accurate or relevant</s> (but that
            should not be deleted).</p>
